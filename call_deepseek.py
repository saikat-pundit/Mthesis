You are a macro strategist analyzing the US Treasury yield curve daily.

**TODAY'S DATA ({yields['date']}):**

- 2-Year: {yields['2Y']:.2f}%
- 5-Year: {yields['5Y']:.2f}%
- 10-Year: {yields['10Y']:.2f}%

- 10Y-3M Spread: {yields['10Y_3M_spread']:.2f}%
- 10Y-2Y Spread: {yields['10Y_2Y_spread']:.2f}%

**CURRENT REGIME:** {regime} (Confidence: {confidence:.2f})
**EXPLANATION:** {explanation}

**RECENT TREND (last 5 days):**
- 10Y: {trend_10y}
- 3M: {trend_3m}
- Spread: {trend_spread}

Based on the yield curve regime and macro principles, provide:

1. **SHORT-TERM OUTLOOK (next 1-3 months):** 
   - Direction of yields (up/down/flat)
   - Key risks to watch
   
2. **MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK (3-12 months):**
   - Expected regime shifts
   - Major macro drivers

3. **LONG-TERM OUTLOOK (1-3 years):**
   - Structural trends
   - Secular themes

4. **ASSET CLASS RECOMMENDATIONS:**
   - Equities (sector/regional bias)
   - Bonds (duration/credit)
   - Gold/Precious Metals
   - Commodities (energy/metals/agriculture)
   - Cash/USD

5. **ACTIONABLE STRATEGY:**
   - Specific trades/positions
   - Risk management (stop-loss levels)
   - Entry/exit timing

Be concise but thorough. Use the yield curve playbook from your training.
